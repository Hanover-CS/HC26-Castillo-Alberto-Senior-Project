# Introduction

This tutorial is a quick, practical ramp-up for Godot 4.x. We will build the core of a brick-breaker style game: a paddle that moves left/right and a ball that bounces. We intentionally keep the syntax simple so you can focus on concepts.

### Who does this apply to?
- Students new to Godot who know basic programming
- Anyone who wants a tiny but complete example to learn the **Godot editor** and **GDScript**

### What you’ll learn
- Creating and organizing **scenes/nodes**
- Handling **keyboard input**
- Moving sprites with **position vectors**
- Simple **collision checks/bounces**
