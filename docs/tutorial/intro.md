# Introduction
---

This tutorial is a practical starter guide for Godot 4.x. Instead of building a full game, we focus on the core systems that make a Brick Breaker–style prototype work: a movable paddle, a bouncing ball, and bricks that react to collisions.

The goal is to build a clean foundation you can expand into your senior project.

## Who is this for?

- College students new to Godot who know basic programming  
- Anyone who wants to practice node-based game development  

---

## What you’ll learn

- Creating and organizing **scenes/nodes**  
- Handling **keyboard input**  
- Moving sprites using **vectors**  
- Detecting collisions using **Area2D** and **RigidBody2D**  
- Connecting scenes using **signals**
