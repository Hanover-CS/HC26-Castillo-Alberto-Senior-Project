# Tutorial: Building a Paddle & Ball in Godot

Welcome! This tutorial walks you through making a tiny 2D arcade prototype in **Godot 4.x** using simple, readable GDScript. It’s designed for beginners who want hands-on practice with nodes, scenes, input, and basic collision logic.

> **Target audience:** College students / beginners with basic programming experience.

> **Learning objectives:**
> - Set up a Godot project and scenes.
> - Move a paddle with keyboard input.
> - Move a ball and implement simple bounces.
> - Wire scenes together and structure a small project.

# Introduction

This tutorial is a quick, practical ramp-up for Godot 4.x. We will build the core of a brick-breaker style game: a paddle that moves left/right and a ball that bounces. We intentionally keep the syntax simple so you can focus on concepts.

### Who is this for?
- Students new to Godot who know basic programming
- Anyone who wants a tiny but complete example to learn the **Godot editor** and **GDScript**

### What you’ll learn
- Creating and organizing **scenes/nodes**
- Handling **keyboard input**
- Moving sprites with **position vectors**
- Simple **collision checks/bounces**
